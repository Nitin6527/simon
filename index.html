   <h1>Welcome to Simon Game.</h1>
   <h2>This game has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases. (This is only one of the games on here, there are actually other games on the original).
   <br>So finally it's a memory game.</h2>
